What should it contain?  General Guidelines:

# What is your verdict?  
# It should be one to two sentences and should follow a similar format to “Response 1 is better than Response 2 because of x, y, z”

Response 2 is better than Response 1 because it uses a more specific parameter according to the user's request. In this case the output is returning almost the same relevant information in both cases so both would fulfill the user requests, but Response 2, between other information in the parameter, includes summarizing in a paragraph or two and is specifing to receive an output for a blog entry.


## What tools were used and why are the tools correct or incorrect?

In both Responses the youtube tool was used to summarize the youtube video contents which is the correct tool for youtube videos.


## What functions were used and why are the functions correct or incorrect?

Also in both cases the youtube.question_answer function was used which is the correct tool for getting text from the video content.

## What parameters were used to address the prompt’s requirements and constraints?  Why are they correct or incorrect?

In the case of Response 1 the "question" parameter works but is vague according to the user's request, it only specifies summerizing the content of the video. In the other hand in Response 2 the "question" parameter is more accurate as it specifies some details in the request that may be relevant: To write a paragraph or two maximum, to use the response for a blog entry and to get information about charters.

## How did each model fulfill the prompt?  Why is one better than the other (or why are they roughly the same)

Both responses fulfill the prompt. In this case the outpus information is almost the same relevant information but in the cases of Response 2, as the addiotional information was added to the function parameter, the output would fit better for the blog post entry.

## Use Evidence/Specific Examples to Back Up Your Justification, your justification should be tailored to your specific task.  DO NOT BE GENERIC, if you are not specific your task is an automatic fail.

For example in the output from Response 2 an additional detail regarding booking availability for charters is specified which is valuable information and attractive for a blog post.

A student wants to find the top 3 most common words in two separate but similar statements: “I love learning and teaching, teaching is fun and learning is even more fun!” and “I love teaching and learning, learning is fun and teaching is even more fun!”. To do this, first separate the sentences and then take the union of the unique words contained in both statements. Next, to determine the frequency of each word within the two statements, count the occurrence of every word within the union. Finally, identify the top 3 most frequent words in the two statements, then calculate and provide the total count of all words within the two statements' union.

1. Use python_interpreter to define two sets and get the union of all the words in sentence A and sentence B. Sentence A: “I love learning and teaching, teaching is fun and learning is even more fun!”. Sentence B: “I love teaching and learning, learning is fun and teaching is even more fun!”
